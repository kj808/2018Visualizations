# EECS731_Visualizations


Visuals describe data better than words. When done correctly, visuals can create an enticing environment for users to learn the discoveries from data science results. In this project, three visual models are explored based on anomalies determined in isolation forests: matplot lib 3D graphs, Bokeh plots for time series, and plotly for time series clustering. The data is taken from the anomaly assignment: Cloud AWS.
