# Visualizations

Description: Visuals describe data better than words. When done correctly, visuals can create an enticing environment for users to learn the discoveries from data science results. In this project, three visual models are explored based on anomalies determined in isolation forests: matplot lib 3D graphs, Bokeh plots for time series, and plotly for time series clustering. The data is taken from the anomaly assignment: Cloud AWS.

Location: Data Science Graduate Course at KU

Dates: Nov 12, 2018 to Dec 1, 2018

## Goal
* Exploring different visuals with anomalies.

## Data
* Amazon Web Services Cloud Watch logs normalized to contain a timestamp, CPU and network utilization, and the elastic load balance.

## Analysis
* 3D plot in matplotlib
* Interactive plot with Bokeh
* Another interactive plot with Plotly

## Results
* N/A
